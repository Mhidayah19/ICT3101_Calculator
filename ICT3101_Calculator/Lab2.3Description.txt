A group of system quality engineers wish to customize the command line calculator program
to perform quality metric calculations. The engineers need to calculate the defect density of a
system. Furthermore, they require a custom calculation for the new total number of Shipped
Source Instructions (SSI) in the successive releases of a system (2nd release onward). The
engineers also wish to be able to use the Musa Logarithmic model to calculate failure intensity
and the number of expected failures, performing each of these using a single calculator
command.

Q19
Epic:
•	Users can calculate defect density using input values for defects and SSI.
•	Users can compute new SSI for successive releases (2nd release onward).
•	Users can calculate failure intensity using the Musa Logarithmic model.
•	Users can calculate expected failures using the Musa Logarithmic model.
•	Each of these calculations is performed via a single command.

Q20
	•	User Story 1:
As a system quality engineer,
I want to calculate defect density based on the number of defects and shipped source instructions (SSI),
So that I can determine the defect ratio for the system.
	•	User Story 2:
As a system quality engineer,
I want to calculate the new total number of shipped source instructions (SSI) for releases from the 2nd onward,
So that I can monitor the system size as it evolves.
	•	User Story 3:
As a system quality engineer,
I want to calculate failure intensity using the Musa Logarithmic model,
So that I can predict the failure rate over time.
